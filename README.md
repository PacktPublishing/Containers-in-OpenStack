# Containers in OpenStack
This is the code repository for [Containers in OpenStack](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/python-finance-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_content=9781787125698), published by Packt. It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.

## About the book
Containers are one of the most talked about technologies of recent times. They have become increasingly popular as they are changing the way we develop, deploy, and run software applications. OpenStack gets tremendous traction as it is used by many organizations across the globe and as containers gain in popularity and become complex, itâ€™s necessary for OpenStack to provide various infrastructure resources for containers, such as compute, network, and storage.

Containers in OpenStack answers the question, how can OpenStack keep ahead of the increasing challenges of container technology? You will start by getting familiar with container and OpenStack basics, so that you understand how the container ecosystem and OpenStack work together. To understand networking, managing application services and deployment tools, the book has dedicated chapters for different OpenStack projects: Magnum, Zun, Kuryr, Murano, and Kolla. 

Towards the end, you will be introduced to some best practices to secure your containers and COE on OpenStack, with an overview of using each OpenStack projects for different use cases.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter 02.

The code will look like the following:
       
       oapiVersion: v1
       kind: Service
       metadata:
          name: wordpress-mysql
          labels:
           app: wordpress
       spec:

## Software requirements:
This book assumes a basic level of understanding of cloud computing, the Linux operating system and containers. The book will guide you through the installation of any tools that are required.

In this book, the following software list is required:
* Operating system: Ubuntu 16.04
* OpenStack: Pike release or newer
* VirtualBox 4.5 or newer
* Vagrant 1.7 or newer

To run the OpenStack installation in a development environment, the following minimum hardware resources are required:

* A host machine with CPU hardware virtualization support
* 8 core CPU
* 12 GB RAM
* 60 GB free disk space
Internet connectivity is required to download the necessary packages for
OpenStack and other tools.
### Note:
This folder contains code files from chapter 02. There are no codes in chapter 04, and 10. For codes of chapter 01, 03, 05, 06, 07, 08, and 09 you can refer the chapter.
